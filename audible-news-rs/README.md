# Audible News Bot (Rust version)

A detailed explanation of this project can be read in the [root README](../README.md).

TODOs for the Rust version:

- [ ] Implement the admin commands and the standard redirect responses.
- [ ] Cache dependencies in a separate Docker layer for faster deployments (e.g. with [cargo-chef](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/cargo-chef)).
